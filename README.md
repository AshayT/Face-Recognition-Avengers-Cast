# Face-Recognition-Avengers-Cast
Here I have used OpenCV's frontal face cascade for face detection and Local Binary Pattern Face Regonizer for face recognition.
I have selected 8 cast from Avengers for this task.
Collected 150 images of each person using Web Scraping and selected best 15 images out of it for training; Used ~ 120 images for training.
